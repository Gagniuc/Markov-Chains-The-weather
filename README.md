# :cloud: Markov Chains The weather
This application uses a transition matrix to make predictions by using a Markov chain. For exemplification, the values from the transition matrix represent the transition probabilities between two states found in a sequence of observations (ex. s=RSRRSRRSRRRRSRRRSSSRRSRRRS). These two states are: Sunny and Rainy, or R and S. Based on the initial probability vector, the application calculates how the weather may be on a number of days. More in-depth information on these matters can be found in the primary source. Note that <i>Markov Chains - The weather</i> is desidned in Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6), thus, the VB6 IDE is needed.
